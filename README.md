# Linear Regression & Decision Tree using Titanic Dataset (Standalone)

## 📘 Overview
This mini project demonstrates the application of **supervised machine learning models** using a **standalone Titanic dataset**.  
The project trains:
- ✅ **Linear Regression** (Regression Task — Predict Fare)
- ✅ **Decision Tree Classifier** (Classification Task — Predict Survival)

This project is **self-contained** and does **not depend** on the output of Mini Project 3.  
A small Titanic-like dataset is created directly inside the Python script.

## 🎯 Objectives
### ✅ Data Preparation
- Create Titanic dataset (Passenger features + Survived label)
- Encode categorical features into numeric form  
- Prepare data for ML models

### ✅ Model Training
- Train Linear Regression model for predicting **Fare**
- Train Decision Tree Classifier for predicting **Survival**

### ✅ Model Evaluation
- Evaluate Linear Regression using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

- Evaluate Decision Tree Classifier using:
  - Accuracy

### ✅ Save Models
Both models are saved in the `model/` folder using **joblib**.
